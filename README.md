# mixed-reality-ux-prototyping-scene
This respository contains my Unity file for testing automotive UX prototypes in mixed reality. To read more about this project, check out [my article on The Turn Signal](https://theturnsignalblog.com/mixed-reality-and-the-future-automotive-ux-testing)

In the scenes folder you will find:
- Version 1: a static scene with my early explorations
- Final version: the result of my exploration with the Quest 3 mixed reality and Unity

To try it out for yourself, follow the next steps:
- Under Edit > Project Settings > Input Manager, set the right input mode (currently set to joystick for use with a gaming wheel)
- Under the VPP JPickup > JPickup asset, there is a 'Passthrough' object with general settings for passthrough, and a 'Passthrough area' object which should be modified to calibrate the space used by the tablet.

If you have a Meta Quest connected via Quest Link, you should now be able to press play and try it out.
